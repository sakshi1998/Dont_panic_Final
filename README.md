# Dont_panic_Final
I have made an emergency handling app(Dontâ€™panic).It is an community based app which suggest you the best hospitals,pharmacy and blood banks you can go at that time based on distance and the real time data of beds availabilty,medicines,blood availability, it also has an emergency button ,when you press that button it gives the notification to the nearby users using our app about the emergency(implemented this with geofire) and provide best hospital ,if he needed he should go at that time.It also tracks down the live location of users whenever the user will be on Wifi and stores in the firebase.
